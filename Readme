This folder contains our three subfolders, one for our implementation of MORE and two with two different implementations of TRPO, that we wrote.



Installation:

You can install the required software to run the code of our project by the following steps:
 - Install conda for python 3.7 as described in http://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/
 - Create a conda environment by executing in this folder:
     conda create --name env --file spec-file.txt
 - Activate the environment by:
     conda activate env
 - Install quanser_robots by executing:
     git clone https://git.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/quanser/clients.git
     cd clients
     pip install -e .
Now everything should be installed.


Running our project:

If you want to run our software, make sure, that you have activated the conda environment.

The TRPO_GAE can be trained by executing in the corresponding folder for example:
 python test.py --save my_new_policy --env CartpoleStabShort-v0
TRPO_GAE can be evaluated by executing in the corresponding folder:
 python evaluate_policy.py
If you want to modify evaluation parameters as the number of episodes or the policy, that shall be evaluated,
you have to modify them in the evaluate_policy script.

TRPO and MORE can both be trained by executing in the corrresponding folder:
 python test.py
Their parameters have to be adapted in the code.
They can also be evaluated by running in the corresponding folder:
 python evaluate policy.py
